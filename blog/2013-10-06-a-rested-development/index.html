Along with late nights working on a few pet projects, it wasn't long before I started to feel the burn (out).</p> <div class=article__content> <p>I was in a terrible spot, burning the candle at both ends. I got migrains for the first time ever, my mood was the lowest it had ever been and I began to notice I was quite unpleasant to be around. I was snapping at people all the time, simple tasks were getting the better of me, I was having trouble focusing and was always tired.</p> <p>Now, I’m quite a tall guy and have lived majority of my life feeling lethargic and run down but a recent trip to the doctor showed that I was fine. No illnesses, no diseases, nothing wrong with any of my organs. Just healthy. So clearly, I needed to change something.</p> <h2 id=the-regime>The Regime</h2> <p>My wife and I got a bit of money back from the taxman (what a guy!) and decided to invest it into our wellbeing. We signed up to our local gym which has a pool and variety of classes like boxing, yoga, cycling, etc. I also started to attend the free yoga classes my work offers every Tuesday.</p> <p>I gotta say. Two weeks into the new regime and I’m feeling much better. I’ve swapped late night coding sessions with an early morning workout.</p> <p>The results:</p> <ul> <li>Improved mood</li> <li>More energetic/new found passion for things</li> <li>Sharper focus on dev tasks</li> <li>Hightened confidence in myself and my work</li> </ul> <h2 id=new-year--new-me>New year / New me</h2> <p>I originally wrote this post back in October and it’s now almost 2014. Unfortunately for me the new regime fell flat as soon as the taxman money dried up (actually I got a little sick of 6:30am starts and easily convinced myself that the sleep in was just as good for me). But I’m not giving up!</p> <p>I have the grand plan of riding to work each day for the entire year (no pressure haha).</p> <p>I’ve already given up coffee for tea (I was addicted)</p> <p>I’ve given my wife permission to rip the laptop from my hands and hit me over the head with a book for me to read once it hits 10pm</p> <p>Lunch time walks around the park near work will also feature heavily as it’s a great excuse to get away from my desk and not just hunch in the kitchen over my tuna wrap.</p> <p>Bascially, I want to be more focused, more energetic and most importantly, more pleasant to be around. I know this has deviated from my plan to blog about my site’s setup but we can always get to that… To me this is super important!</p> <p>If you’ve identified with anything I’ve mentioned here I urge you to make the switch and look after yourself. You’ll feel better for doing so.</p> <p>T</p> </div> <p> <strong>TOPICS:</strong> <a href="/blog/topics/opinion">opinion</a> </p> </article> <ul class="list--clean list--article-nav"> <li class=prev> <a href="/blog/2013-09-08-youre-doing-it-peter/" title="Previous article">&#171; <span class=is-small--inline>Previous Article</span></a> </li> <li class=next> <a href="/blog/2013-12-29-the-bells-and-the-whistles/" title="Next article"><span class=is-small--inline>Next Article</span> &#187;</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> <footer class=footer role=contentinfo> <div class=container> <div class=blurb> <div class=media> <img src="/img/elements/profile-mini.svg" onerror="this.onerror=null; this.src='/img/elements/profile-mini.png'" alt="" class="media__image blurb__headshot"/> <div class="media__body blurb__content"> <p>I'm Tom, a front end developer from Melbourne Australia.</p> <p>The thoughts and opinions on this site are all mine.</p> </div> </div> </div> <small>&copy; 2015 Tom Gillard.</small> <small class=is-large>Built with <a href="//middlemanapp.com" target=_blank>Middleman</a> using the <a href="//smacss.com/" target=_blank>SMACSS</a> css architecture.</small> <small id=contact>Feel free to grab the <a href="/feed.xml">feed</a> and/or <a href="//twitter.com/tom_gillard" target=_blank>follow me on Twitter</a>.</small> </div> </footer> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script> <script>!window.jQuery && document.write(unescape('%3Cscript src="/js/libs/jquery-1.9.1.min.js"%3E%3C/script%3E'));</script> <script src="js/site-scripts.js"></script> <script>
