intro: The last few months have been pretty full on at work. Along with late nights working on a few pet projects, it wasn't long before I started to feel the burn (out).

I was in a terrible spot, burning the candle at both ends. I got migrains for the first time ever, my mood was the lowest it had ever been and I began to notice I was quite unpleasant to be around. I was snapping at people all the time, simple tasks were getting the better of me, I was having trouble focusing and was always tired.

Now, I'm quite a tall guy and have lived majority of my life feeling lethargic and run down but a recent trip to the doctor showed that I was fine. No illnesses, no diseases, nothing wrong with any of my organs. Just healthy. So clearly, I needed to change something.

##The Regime
My wife and I got a bit of money back from the taxman (what a guy!) and decided to invest it into our wellbeing. We signed up to our local gym which has a pool and variety of classes like boxing, yoga, cycling, etc. I also started to attend the free yoga classes my work offers every Tuesday.

I gotta say. Two weeks into the new regime and I'm feeling much better. I've swapped late night coding sessions with an early morning workout.

The results:

- Improved mood
- More energetic/new found passion for things
- Sharper focus on dev tasks
- Hightened confidence in myself and my work

##New year / New me

I originally wrote this post back in October and it's now almost 2014. Unfortunately for me the new regime fell flat as soon as the taxman money dried up (actually I got a little sick of 6:30am starts and easily convinced myself that the sleep in was just as good for me). But I'm not giving up!

I have the grand plan of riding to work each day for the entire year (no pressure haha).

I've already given up coffee for tea (I was addicted)

I've given my wife permission to rip the laptop from my hands and hit me over the head with a book for me to read once it hits 10pm

Lunch time walks around the park near work will also feature heavily as it's a great excuse to get away from my desk and not just hunch in the kitchen over my tuna wrap.

Bascially, I want to be more focused, more energetic and most importantly, more pleasant to be around. I know this has deviated from my plan to blog about my site's setup but we can always get to that... To me this is super important!

If you've identified with anything I've mentioned here I urge you to make the switch and look after yourself. You'll feel better for doing so.
