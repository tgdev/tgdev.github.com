intro: Middleman's blog engine is pretty powerful. Check out the following article from a fellow blogger that helped me get this site up and running.

The [Middleman docs on blogging](http://middlemanapp.com/basics/blogging/) have a lot of great info to get you started with building your own blog using middleman but if you want more of a step by step how-to, [Design by Joel](http://designbyjoel.com/) has a really great article on [building a blog in middleman](http://designbyjoel.com/blog/2012-10-20-building-a-blog-in-middleman/).

Enjoy!
