intro: Today's the first day of 2014 and I'd like to set the theme for the new year
---

It's really quite simple: do more.

I feel the need to participate and put myself out there more than I have in the past.

To quote weezer:

> I don't wanna be an old man anymore / 
> It's been a year or two since I was out on the floor / 
> Shakin' booty, makin' sweet love all the night / 
> It's time I got back to the Good Life / 
> It's time I got back, it's time I got back / 
> And I don't even know how I got off the track / 
> I wanna go back...Yeah!

So that means more;

- blogging
- reading
- basketball
- travel
- time with friends
- learning new skills
- challenging myself

Hopefully this blog will help achieve a lot of the above.

Happy new year!
