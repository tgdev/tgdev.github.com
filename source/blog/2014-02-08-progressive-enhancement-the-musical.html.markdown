intro: I've been reading a lot about progressive enhancement lately and I've realised something, there's a lot of creative parallels between building a site and writing a song; you're telling a story. So I decided to pen this little diddy which goes a little something like this...
---

###Verse 1
**Lyrics and Form** is your content layer (HTML). It can be spoken or read with no beat or melody and still engage an audience.

###Verse 2
**Rhythm and Melody** is your presentation layer (css). Adds style and feeling to the words, giving the song the ebb and flow it needs to connect to it's audience.

###Verse 3
**Instrumentation and Production** is your behaviour layer (javascript). Fleshing out a well written lyric, against a moving beat and melody, with a rich pallet of instrumentation and effects can really tip a song over the edge and make it a hit. Same goes for your sites UI experience.

###Chorus
Progressive enhancement aims to offer users an enjoyable experience regardless of the end users browser or device. This is achieved by offering the core content via symantic HTML and enhancing with CSS and Javascript to those browsers and devices that can take advantage of those enhancements.

Just like an artist giving a great performance regardless of the gear they're using (full blown band with mics and a PA vs their voice and an acoustic guitar) or the location they're in (areana vs someones garage or livingroom); if it's a great story it's going to engage.

###Bridge
Now of course there are exceptions to the rule where songs don't particularly have any story to tell but are hugely successful. Songs that feature a solid beat, repetative chorus and douches thrusting their junk in tight, brightly coloured undies. These are usually flash in the pans with no substance and are quickly forgotten.

###Coda
I remember hearing Alice Cooper saying something along the lines of how a great song should only need to be sung and played on a piano to know it's a great song.

So put your content center stage, adding layers to make a connection and ensure your audience goes wild, singing your story loud!
